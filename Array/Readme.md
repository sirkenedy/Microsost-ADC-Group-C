## Implement a flexible array that allows the array to increase when we want to insert a new element while the array is at capacity.

## Your input is an array of integers, and you must reorder its entries so that the even entries appear first. This is easy if you use 0(n) space, where n is the length of the array. However, you are required to solve it without allocating additional storage.

## Write a program that takes an array A and an index i into A and rearranges the elements such that all elements less than A[i] (the "pivot") appear first, followed by elements equal to the pivot, followed by elements greater than the pivot. Do not use an additional collection.
